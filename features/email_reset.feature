  A user
  Should be able to reset the email address associated with my account
  
    Scenario: User resets email address

      And I am on my edit profile page
      When I fill in "Email address" with "email@newperson.com"
      And I press "Reset email address"
      Then an email entitled "Account confirmation" should be sent to "email@newperson.com"
